    In order for PBS to work, everyone who is involved in the
    individual’s life must be on the same page. Working together
    requires that everyone 1) communicate openly, 2) develop plans that
    make sense and can be utilized everywhere the individual’s needs
    dictate assistance, and 3) share goals and responsibilities. PBS
    Corp engages caregivers in the assessment and intervention process
    to the greatest extent possible. That means obtaining input through
    interviews and self-recording of data, collaboratively identifying
    strategies based on patterns identified (e.g., rather than simply
    developing plans and giving them to the parent or teacher), and
    providing sufficient training caregivers can fully implement all
    interventions themselves.
