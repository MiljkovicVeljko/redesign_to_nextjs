    An accurate understanding of an individual’s behavior, circumstances
    that set the stage for their behavior to occur, and results the
    behavior produces must precede intervention. Therefore, PBS Corp
    team members – under the direction of the contracted behavior
    analyst – complete record reviews, interviews, and direct
    observations across circumstances in which the individual
    participates. They also may conduct types of assessments to evaluate
    the person’s needs, current skills, and environmental features that
    may affect intervention.
