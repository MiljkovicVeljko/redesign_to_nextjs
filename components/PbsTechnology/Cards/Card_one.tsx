    <p className='mb-5'>A wide variety of interventions are available for addressing behavioral challenges and, in particular, for treating children with autism.</p>
    <p className='mb-5'>Not all of these interventions have scientific evidence to support their use. PBS Corp believes in using only evidence-based interventions. That means adopting procedures that have a strong theoretical basis, have been subjected to rigorous research, and have been demonstrated to produce observable behavior changes with the individuals who will be receiving services.</p>
    <p className='mb-5'>Such practices have been summarized in that National Standards Report and ABA Guidelines for ASD and are articulated through national associations such as the Associations for Applied Behavior Analysis and Positive Behavior Support. Families and professionals being supported by PBS Corp are encouraged to seek empirical support for the strategies being used.</p>
