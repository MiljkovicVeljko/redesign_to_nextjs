    The effectiveness of behavioral interventions is measured in terms
    of the degree to which problem behavior is reduced and positive
    behavior is increased. PBS Corp contractors collect behavioral data

    decisions regarding treatment, prepare reports on outcomes, and
    communicate with for consumers, funders, and regulatory bodies.
