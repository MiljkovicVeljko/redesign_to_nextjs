    Although reducing behavioral challenges and developing skills are
    important, the overriding goal of PBS is to help individuals and
    families live more positive, productive, and enriching lives.
    Person-centered approaches are geared toward helping individuals and
    their families do more things, go more places, and achieve other
    personal goals. To this end, PBS Corp addresses not only changes in
    behavior, but also quality of life. PBS Corp team members engage
    individuals, family members, and service providers in a
    person-centered planning process to identify desired outcomes,
    ensure that the support strategies are geared to meeting those
    goals, and overcome any barriers to an individualâ€™s success.
