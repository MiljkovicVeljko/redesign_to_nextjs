      <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong>
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
      concerning the subject matter hereof, which may only be modified as set
      forth in this Agreement. The Website is controlled and operated by PBS
      Corp. We assume no responsibility, and shall not be liable for any damages
      to, or viruses that may infect, worms, Trojan horses, your computer
      equipment or other property on account of your access to, use of, or
      browsing in the Website or your downloading of any Content from the
      Website. We make no representation that materials in the Website are
      appropriate or available for use in other jurisdictions. Those who choose
      to access the Website from other jurisdictions do so on their own
      initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, including,
      without limitation, laws regarding import/export of technical data by
      virtue of your online transmission, if and to the extent such laws are
      applicable. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
      otherwise, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
      Florida without giving effect to its choice of law rules. You expressly
      agree that jurisdiction for any claim or dispute relating to or arising
      out of this Agreement resides exclusively in the courts of Martin County
      in the State of Florida, and expressly consent to the personal
      jurisdiction thereof. If any provision in this Agreement should be held
      illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the extent
      necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent, or severed
      from this Agreement if no such modification is possible, and other
      provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, or we
      may at our option instead terminate this Agreement. A waiver by either
      party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in
      any one instance, shall not waive such term or condition or any subsequent
      breach thereof. You may not assign or otherwise transfer by operation of
      law or otherwise this Agreement or any rights or obligations herein. We
      may assign this Agreement to any entity at our sole discretion. This
      Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
      parties, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and permitted
      assigns. No delay or failure to take action under this Agreement shall
      constitute any waiver by us of any provision of this Agreement.
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement waives
      or limits extra-contractual rights or remedies available to us to protect
      our rights or property, including, but not limited to, those available
      under U.S. copyright law, international treaties or copyright or
      intellectual property laws of the countries in which the Website or
      Services are used.
